# Chess-engine 
In computer chess, a chess engine is a computer program that analyzes chess or chess variant positions, and generates a move or list of moves that it regards as strongest.

how do chess engines work?
By using algorithms and heuristics to make decisions about the best move in a certain position/situation
Usually a back end with a command-line interface with no graphics
Used with a front-end/GUI


Tech and approach
We have used JavaScript and min-max algorithm  and alpha-beta pruning to create this engine.
